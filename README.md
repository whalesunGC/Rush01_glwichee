Hi Team Guidlines Below 

:lock:Github project membership March 09th 1400hrs GMT+8 - Everyone should be a member of the GitHub project I've created by the deadline. If not, we'll stop work immediately. I will send out the last invite by 1345 so please contact me if you have not receive the invite asap!   
:lock:Attempt rush01 on your own - March 9th 1800hrs GMT+8 - Upon having access to the github project, you can start working on your own to try rush01. You don't have to complete it but you should **submit your files to /src/development/[your 42 id]** directory and push the code by 1800hrs. You must be able to explain the "logic" of what you submitted since it's your own work. Failure to do so will result in immediate stoppage of work on the project.  
:lock:Schedule Team call - March 10th 1100hrs GMT+8 - We'll will schedule a team call on Sunday. If we fail to set a time before March 3rd 1100hrs due to no common free time, we'll stop the project. The team call will allow us to discuss and finalise our rush01 design based on the cumulation of our work on rush01. 
:lock:Project submission - March 9thd2200hrs GMT+8 - We'll need to either all go down as a team or have unanimous agreement on who will go back to submit the project.  

Lets go! Do Slack DM / WA me if unsure of the above :))
